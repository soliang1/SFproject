<p class="black"> Pier 39! One of the most exciting things about the city. The Pier, as stated before, has a lot of activities you could do there! From the Seals to the Mirror Maze to the never ending amazing dishes/food! I suggest if you're planning to hang out at the Pier 39, make sure the weather is looking hot.. you won't regret it! <p

  <p class="black">Now, this is the famous Twin Peaks, I find this place very calm and just a beautiful place in general, as you can see in the photo, it has an amazing view of the city that you  could die for. As it is also San Francisco's tallest “ building”  it is really an amazing place to visit during your free time whether you wanted to take a hike or to just go there and visit and to just take a picture for the gram.  </p>
